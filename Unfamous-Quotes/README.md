# Spring RestRepository + Backbone

## What it can do
on the server side : Spring Boot with a RepositoryRestResource against an in-memory DB
on the client side : backbone, backbone-hal (with minor change, requirejs, lodash 
(there is a working version with curl, which I will remove soon)

listing, adding & deleting items client & server side 


## What it cannot do yet

editing of existing quotes, different DB, Spring Security (login and authenication)

## What else is to do
clean up of backbone JS, general clean up
