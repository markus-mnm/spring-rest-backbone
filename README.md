spring-rest-backbone
====================

Start of a very simple app to list, add, change & delete using a backbonejs client against a Spring-Boot Rest/hateos service.



First off:

## Unfamous-Quotes

### What it can do
on the server side : Spring Boot with a RepositoryRestResource against an in-memory DB
on the client side : backbone, backbone-hal (with minor change, requirejs, lodash 
(there is a working version with curl, which I will remove soon)

listing, adding & deleting items client & server side 


### What it cannot do yet

editing of existing quotes, different DB, Spring Security (login and authenication)

### What else is to do
clean up of backbone JS, general clean up
